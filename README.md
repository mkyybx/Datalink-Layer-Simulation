# Datalink-Layer-Simulation
A selective repeat protocol simulation

The simulation program is designed to test the performance and the stability of the selective repeat protocol.

---
You can change the parameters by changing the the following three varaibles in *selective.cpp*
```
windowSize = 62;//slide window size
retimer = 2500;//retransmit timer, in ms
acktimer = 800;//ACK frame retransmit timer,in ms
```
